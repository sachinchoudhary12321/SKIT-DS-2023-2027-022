**Crop Care** is an AI-powered agricultural diagnosis platform developed as a college project at **Swami Keshvanand Institute of Technology, Management & Gramothan, Jaipur (SKIT)**. The project enables automated classification of **15 distinct wheat plant diseases and pests** from field photographs, providing actionable treatment recommendations.

## 🔬 Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Cleaning & Extraction (`dataset_analysis.ipynb`)
- **Leakage Elimination:** Purges exact duplicate leaf images found in both `train/` and `test/` sets using MD5 hash auditing.
- **Label Conflict Resolution:** Purges images assigned contradictory disease labels (e.g., same leaf labeled as both *Black Rust* and *Brown Rust*).
- **Deduplication:** Keeps strictly 1 unique representative image per hash to eliminate redundancy.
- **Stratified Partition:** Splits the conflict-free image pool into **80% Train**, **10% Validation**, and **10% Test**.

### 2. Model Development (`model_development.ipynb`)
- **Pipeline:** Optimized `tf.data.Dataset` with parallel prefetching (`AUTOTUNE`) and data augmentation.
- **Class Balancing:** Computes balanced class weights to eliminate majority class bias.
- **Baseline Custom CNN:** 3-block ConvNet with `BatchNormalization`, `MaxPooling2D`, and `GlobalAveragePooling2D` (eliminating the 15.7M-weight flatten flaw).
- **Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2):**
  - **Phase 1 (Feature Extraction):** Backbone frozen, trains custom classification head ($lr = 10^{-3}$) for 5 epochs.
  - **Phase 2 (Deep Fine-Tuning):** Unfreezes top 30 layers with delicate learning rate ($lr = 10^{-5}$) for 7 epochs.

### 3. Performance Analysis (`model_performance.ipynb`)
- **Un-leaked Test Evaluation:** Evaluates both models on the uncontaminated `clean_test_ds`.
- **Metrics:** Full Scikit-Learn `classification_report` (Precision, Recall, F1 for all 15 classes).
- **Heatmaps:** Side-by-side normalized Confusion Matrices.
- **Leaf Diagnosis Engine:** Standalone `diagnose_wheat_leaf()` function outputting top-3 disease probabilities and agronomic treatment guidance.

### 4. Risk Analysis & Operational Safety (`risk_analysis.ipynb` & `RISK_ANALYSIS.md`)
- **Pathology Risk Index (PRI):** Multi-factor scoring (yield loss %, $R_0$, intervention latency, quarantine threat) establishing risk tiers from Tier 1 (Extreme Crisis: *Blast*, *Black Rust*) to Tier 5 (Zero Risk: *Healthy*).
- **Asymmetric Cost Matrix ($15 \times 15$):** FMEA failure cost model penalizing critical false negatives ($C_{i, \text{Healthy}} \le 100$) vs mild false positives ($C_{\text{Healthy}, j} = 15$).
- **Empirical Bayes Risk Benchmark:** Fine-tuned model achieves a **70.4% reduction in expected operational risk** and zero critical false negatives.
- **Safety Decision Thresholding ($\tau = 0.25$):** Prioritizes $>98\%$ recall on quarantine pathogens to prevent field escapes.
- **Production Advisory Engine:** Standalone `diagnose_with_risk_advisory()` integrating Shannon entropy uncertainty gating and automated farm escalation protocols.
